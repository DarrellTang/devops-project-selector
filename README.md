# DevOps Project Selector

A web-based tool to help developers and operations professionals find their next DevOps learning project based on their current skills and background.

🔗 **[Try it live](https://darrelltang.github.io/devops-project-selector/)**

## 🎯 What This Does

- **Two specialized tracks**: Developer Track and Operations Track
- **Progressive skill levels**: From beginner to advanced with clear steps
- **Atomic project recommendations**: Specific, actionable projects you can start today
- **Natural progression**: Each project builds on previous skills with clear upgrade/replace patterns
- **Bridge convergence**: Shows where dev and ops tracks meet and cross-train

## 🚀 Why This Exists

DevOps learning is overwhelming. There are hundreds of tools, concepts, and practices. Most people don't know:
- What to learn next based on their current skills
- Whether they should focus on development or operations first
- How different DevOps tools relate to each other
- What projects will actually teach them useful skills

This tool solves that by providing **personalized, actionable guidance** based on where you are right now.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Two-Track Approach
- **Developer Track**: For people with coding backgrounds who need to learn infrastructure and operations
- **Operations Track**: For people with server/infrastructure backgrounds who need to learn application deployment

### Atomic Learning
Instead of "learn Kubernetes," the tool recommends specific projects like:
- "Deploy to managed Kubernetes cluster" 
- "Learn Kubernetes networking and storage"
- "Implement GitOps for K8s deployments"

### Iterative Progression
Projects show how you're improving your existing setup:
- 🏗️ **Build**: Create something new
- 🔄 **Upgrade**: Make existing things better  
- 🔀 **Replace**: Switch to better approaches
- ➕ **Add**: Enhance with new capabilities
- 🚀 **Launch**: Deploy to production

### Bridge Point
Both tracks eventually converge at a "Bridge Level" where:
- Developers learn operations, infrastructure, and production concerns
- Ops folks learn development, application architecture, and developer workflows

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Choose your background** - Developer or Operations
2. **Select your current level** - Where you are right now in your journey
3. **Get project recommendations** - 2-3 specific, actionable projects
4. **See the progression** - Understand how each project improves your setup
5. **Level up** - Come back after completing projects to see what unlocks next

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

This tool is based on the idea that DevOps is best learned through:

- **Friction-free progression**: Each step should feel like a natural next step, not a giant leap
- **Building on strengths**: Developers start with code, ops folks start with infrastructure
- **Real projects**: Every recommendation is something you can actually build
- **Iterative improvement**: You're constantly upgrading and improving what you built before
- **Cross-training**: Eventually everyone needs to learn both sides

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

Just open [the tool](https://darrelltang.github.io/devops-project-selector/) and:

1. Click your background (Developer or Operations)
2. Click your current skill level
3. Start with the first recommended project
4. Come back when you're done to see what's next

## 🤝 Contributing

This tool is designed to be a living resource. Ideas for improvements:

- More granular skill levels
- Additional bridge points between tracks
- Tool-specific guidance (AWS vs Azure vs GCP)
- Time estimates for projects
- Links to tutorials and resources
- Community project sharing

Feel free to open issues or submit PRs!

## 📈 Example Learning Paths

### Developer Journey
Git → CI/CD → VM deployment → Containerization → Managed services → Local K8s → Production K8s → Bridge (learn ops)

### Operations Journey  
Git → Cloud VMs → Terraform → Application deployment → Containers → Local K8s → Production K8s → Bridge (learn dev)

### Convergence
Both tracks meet at advanced Kubernetes, GitOps, platform engineering, and SRE practices.

## 🎓 Philosophy: Start Where You Are

The biggest mistake in DevOps learning is trying to learn everything at once. This tool helps you:

- **Start with your strengths** instead of starting over
- **Take one step at a time** instead of jumping to complex topics
- **Build on what you know** instead of learning in isolation
- **See the big picture** while focusing on next actions

Happy learning! 🚀
